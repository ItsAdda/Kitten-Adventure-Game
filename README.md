# 🐾 Kitten Adventure

A **2D adventure game** built in **Python (Pygame)** — a passion project I’m making for my girlfriend 💖  
You play as a **curious kitten** exploring the world, collecting fish, upgrading your abilities, and fighting off jellyfish enemies.  
Still a **work in progress**, but it’s shaping up into a cozy little game with smooth controls and a bit of challenge!
