## ▶️ How to Run

1. Make sure you have **Python 3.10+** installed.  
   - You can check by opening Command Prompt and typing:  
     ```bash
     python --version
     ```
     If it doesn’t work, install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Install **Pygame** by running this in your terminal or command prompt:  
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   
3. Open the folder in your terminal and run:
